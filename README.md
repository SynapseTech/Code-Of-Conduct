<!-- # Code-Of-Conduct
Here at Synapse, we aim to improve the lives of everyday people through tech. In order to accomplish this, we need to set certain ground rules for our public projects.

When contributing to our open source projects, we hold all outside contributors to the same standards we hold ourselves to when contributing to other open source. This means contributions need to be meaningful and in line with the project's vision.

With that in mind, there are also certain rules we ask that all our contributors follow:
- Firstly, and most importantly, consider how your actions affect the individual. The goal of all our software is to make the lives of our end users better. Think about a change and how it will affect the end user down the chain before you finalize it.
- Secondly, we ask that you remain considerate of other contributors -->
